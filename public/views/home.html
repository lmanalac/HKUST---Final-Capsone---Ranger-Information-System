      <h3>Project Requirement</h3>
      <p>
          California State Park Ranger Nathan Gore is in charge of inspecting off road vehicle facilities at California Law Enforcement locations throughout the state. He has a form he has to fill out but wants to make the paperwork step as efficient as possible. He has created a Word document that if one filled it out by hand that would meet State requirements --- can you design either a user interface or other solution that can save Officer Gore from doing paperwork so he can get back out in our parks to keep them safe?
        Officer Gore follows up: "... it would be nice to have as many of those fields with drop-down boxes as possible especially if the drop-down boxes had options in them that the user could easily add change or delete..."

      <h3>Proposed Solution</h3>
      <p>
        Develop “RIS” the Ranger Inspection System, a Web-Based, Form Management System that will allow Ranger Gore to document the inspection of road vehicle facilities at California Law Enforcement locations.
        RIS should have the following design goals:
        Efficiency – Information should only have to be entered once, so that users will not have to laboriously re-enter data.
        User Friendly – Information should be pre-entered when possible, and given good default values when appropriate. Choices should have drop-down boxes and reasonable options whenever possible.
        Accessible – RIS should be accessible from multiple types of computing devices (e.g. PC, Laptop, Table or Phone). RIS should be available even when there is no Internet Service. RIS should store data locally when not connected, and upload to the Server when connectivity is restored.

      <h3>RIS Implementation</h3>
      <p>
      RIS could be implemented as a three-tier Web-Application, with a Presentation Tier written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The Application Tier could be in implemented in Node JS and Express. The Data Tier could be developed using Mongo DB.

      <h3>What is a Three-Tier Architecture System?</h3>
      <p>
        A three-tier architecture is a client-server architecture in which the functional process logic, data access, computer data storage and user interface are developed and maintained as independent modules on separate platforms. Three-tier architecture is a software design pattern and a well-established software architecture.
      Three-tier architecture allows any one of the three tiers to be upgraded or replaced independently. The user interface is implemented on a desktop PC and uses a standard graphical user interface with different modules running on the application server. The relational database management system on the database server contains the computer data storage logic. The middle tiers are usually multitiered.
      The three tiers in a three-tier architecture are:
      Presentation Tier: Occupies the top level and displays information related to services available on a website. This tier communicates with other tiers by sending results to the browser and other tiers in the network.

      Application Tier: Also called the middle tier, logic tier, business logic or logic tier, this tier is pulled from the presentation tier. It controls application functionality by performing detailed processing.

      Data Tier: Houses database servers where information is stored and retrieved. Data in this tier is kept independent of application servers or business logic.
